# bloc-jams-jquery
A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app

Bloc jams was an academic exercise that sought to familiarize me with jQuery, and had me assist in finishing off player features using javascript. I forked the base project files over, but helped display all the relevant album info within the player, completed functions like play/pause, next/previous, and slidebar usability, and assisted making it a usable player.
