# Summary #
Bloc jams was a project that familiarized me with jQuery, where I assisted in finishing off player features using javascript. I forked the base project files over, and subesquently displayed all the relevant album info within the player, completed functions like play/pause, next/previous, and slidebar usability, and assisted making it a usable player.
